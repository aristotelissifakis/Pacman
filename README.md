# Pacman
In the simplified world of the problem there are four consecutive adjacent cells, numbered from 1 to 4. In some of the cells there may be a unique fruit, but this is not necessary. Also, in any of these four cells there is a pacman that can move to an adjacent cell, left or right. The permissible situations in which the problem can be found are determined by the combinations of relations between its objects. A state is determined both by the pacman's cell in any of the cells, and by which cells contain fruit (see Figure 1). Any allowable state, in which the problem world can be found at the beginning of the problem solution, can be defined as the initial state. The goal of the problem is to eat all the fruit and leave the pacman alone in one of the 4 cells.
